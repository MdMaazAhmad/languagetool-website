    <h1>Apply for GSoC 2018</h1>
    
    <p>LanguageTool is a mentor organization in this year's Google Summer of Code. As a student who is
        interested in software development, you can apply to participate. If you're selected, you will
        work on LanguageTool for three months and Google will pay you.

    <p>Here's how Google describes GSoC:</p>

    <div style="background-color: #eee; padding:5px">
        <p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> is Google's summer program for university students to 
            learn about, and get involved in open source. It's happening again for the 14th year in 2018! Over 13,000 students 
            from 108 countries have participated.
    
        <p>Google Summer of Code is a unique program where students are paired with a mentor to introduce them to the open 
            source community and provide guidance while they work on a real world open source project during their summer break 
            from university. Projects cover a wide range of fields including: Cloud, Operating Systems, Graphics, Medicine, 
            Programming Languages, Robotics, Science, Security and many more. This is not an internship but still 
            provides an invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!
    
        <p>The application period opens on March 12, 2018 and ends on March 27th, 2018. It's a highly competitive 
            program (and this year is expected to be even bigger than last year), so don't wait to the last minute to prepare!
